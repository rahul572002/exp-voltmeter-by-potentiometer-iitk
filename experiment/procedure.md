A) Calibrating a Ammeter using a potentiometer is as follows:
<br>
Calibrating an ammeter using a potentiometer involves comparing the readings of the ammeter with the known voltage drops across a resistor. Here's a general procedure to calibrate an ammeter using a potentiometer:
<br>
Materials Required:
1. Ammeter to be calibrated
2. Potentiometer (with a known resistance value)
3. Power supply
4. Connecting wires
5. Resistors for creating voltage drops (optional)

<br>
1. Set up the Circuit:
   (a) Connect the potentiometer in series with the ammeter and a power supply. The ammeter should be connected in series so that the entire current flows through it.
   (b) Ensure that the potentiometer is connected so that the current flows from the positive terminal of the power supply, through the potentiometer, through the ammeter, and back to the negative terminal of the power supply.
   
2. Adjust Potentiometer:
   (a) Adjust the potentiometer so that a known voltage drop (let's say V) is created across it. You can calculate this voltage drop using Ohm's law: V = I * R, where I is the current flowing through the circuit and R is the resistance of the potentiometer.
   
3. Measure Current:
   (a) Read the current indicated by the ammeter.
4. Compare Readings:
   (a) Compare the current indicated by the ammeter with the calculated current (I) from the known voltage drop across the potentiometer.
   (b) If there is a discrepancy between the two readings, adjust the calibration of the ammeter accordingly. Some ammeters have a calibration screw or knob that allows you to adjust the reading.
5. Repeat if Necessary:
   (a) If the readings are not matching, repeat the process by adjusting the potentiometer and recalibrating the ammeter until you achieve accurate readings.
6. Validation:
   (a) Once you are satisfied with the calibration, you can validate it by measuring currents in other circuits and comparing them with known values.
7. Final Adjustment:
   (a) Once you're confident in the calibration, make any final adjustments to the ammeter if necessary and ensure that it is securely fixed in its housing.
8. Documentation:
   (a) Record the calibration process, including any adjustments made, and keep this documentation for future reference.

Remember to exercise caution while working with electrical circuits, especially when dealing with power supplies and live wires. Ensure that all connections are secure and that the equipment is handled safely to avoid accidents.

B) Calibrating an voltmeter using a potentiometer is as follows:
<br>
Calibrating a voltmeter with a potentiometer involves adjusting the potentiometer until the voltage output matches the desired value indicated on the voltmeter. Here's a general procedure:
<br>
1. Setup:
   (a) Connect the voltmeter to the circuit or device you want to measure the voltage of. Ensure the circuit is powered on if necessary.
   (b) Connect the potentiometer in series with the voltmeter.
2. Initial Setup:
   (a) Set the potentiometer to its midpoint initially. This ensures that you have room to both increase and decrease the voltage output.
3. Adjustment:
   (a) Turn on the voltmeter and observe the reading.
   (b) Adjust the potentiometer knob slowly until the voltmeter reads the desired voltage.
   (c) If the voltage reading is too high, decrease the resistance of the potentiometer by turning the knob in one direction. If it's too low, increase the resistance by turning the knob in the opposite direction.
   (d) Make small adjustments and observe the voltmeter reading until it matches the desired voltage accurately.
4. Fine-tuning:
   (a) Once you are close to the desired voltage, make finer adjustments to the potentiometer to achieve precise calibration.
   (b) It may take a few iterations of adjustment and observation to get the voltmeter accurately calibrated.
5. Verification:
   (a) Once you believe the voltmeter is correctly calibrated, verify the voltage reading by comparing it to a known reference voltage or by using another calibrated instrument if available.
6. Finalization:
   (a) Once you are satisfied with the calibration, secure the potentiometer in place to prevent accidental adjustments.
   (b) Label the potentiometer setting or make note of its position for future reference.
7. Testing:
   (a) Test the voltmeter across different voltage levels to ensure that it remains calibrated within an acceptable margin of error.
8. Documentation:
   (a) Document the calibration process, including the initial and final voltages, any adjustments made, and the final potentiometer setting. This documentation will be useful for future reference and recalibration if necessary.

Remember to follow safety procedures while working with electrical circuits, and ensure that the equipment is properly grounded to prevent accidents or damage to the equipment.
